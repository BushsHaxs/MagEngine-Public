Step one: Rename or create your xml file names to be named the exact same below (This is required)
Idle
Sing Up
Sing Left
Sing Right
Sing Down



Step two: grab your png and xml files(generated by adobe animate) and name them "customchar" in number order(eg. customcharone, customchartwo, customcharthree, etc.) 
as of right now Mag Engine can support up to twenty custom characters.

Step three: Make a text file called "(your customchar name here)Offsets" and edit it to your liking (Use the first custom character offsets file as a template)

Step four: Put the customchar's name in assets/data/characterList.

Step five: Go into a song and press seven on your keyboard, then go to the "song" section in the menu that pops up, On the right hand side of the two character dropdown
menus, click it, then select your character name.


With a little tweaking, you should have a fully rendered character in no time!
